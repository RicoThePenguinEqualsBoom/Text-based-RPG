# Text-based-RPG
A text rpg made based on the Scott Lilly tutoriel <br>
Just a way for me to access it from on the go but if anybody wants to participate feel free to.<br>

I have very beginner concepts of c# as i'm starting this, so, lets see how far I can go. <br>
Check out the tutoriel I'm following https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/
